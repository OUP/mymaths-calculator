# mymaths-calculator

This is an early prototype for a scientific calculator built in React, to go in the new MyMaths player.

To build locally, `yarn install` then `yarn start`. Open a browser at `http://localhost:3000` if one doesn't open automatically.
Click buttons to make things happen. Caveats below.

# Known errors

The following buttons are still idle:
`frac`
`%`
`ENG`
`Ï€`
shifted buttons

Nested brackets `(())` are buggy.

Cursor skips.

Using multiple decimal points in a number outputs weird values instead of `syntax error`.

Output values can be imprecise due to solvable errors with floating point arithmetic.

-+3 gives an infinite loop.

Error if you try to retrieve a stored input before one exists.

# Compulsory improvements

Set rad, degrees, grad modes for trig functions.

Handle surds correctly.

Add in functionality to store variables.

Add hotkeys.

Better cursor.

Improve design.

# Optional improvements

MathJax/LaTeX rendering of fractions and surds.

Stats and table modes.

Add in some of the functionality for an A Level graphical calculator, e.g. graphs (once grapher is done!) and algebra.
